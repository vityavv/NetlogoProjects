# NetLogo Projects

These are the projects I made for my first term Computer Science class in 10th grade. You can read more about every project in the Info section of the NetLogo file (either by opening the file in NetLogo or just finding the section in the raw file).

## Snake

The assignment was to extend a basic Snake game with new features. I used NetLogo's HubNet feature, which allows users to host a server which clients can join and allows the user to customize the appearance and functionality of the clients, to make the game multiplayer, mimicking the popular game slither.io.

## Animation

The assignment was to create a short animation, referencing no files outside of the original NetLogo file. I wrote a program to turn images and audio into NetLogo code, but the plot is pretty cheesy and boring because I am not very creative.

## DAW

This was the final project for the class. I wrote a sort of Digital Audio Workstation/Sequencer which gives you 4 tracks (plus a drum track) to create a song. There are numerous features, enough that I made a demo video demonstrating them. I'm very proud of this.
